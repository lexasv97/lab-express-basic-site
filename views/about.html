    <p>Lionel Messi is an Argentinian soccer player who has played for FC Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain, and the
        Argentina national team. As a teenager, Messi moved from Argentina to Spain after FC Barcelona agreed to pay for
        medical treatments related to his growth hormone disorder. At the club, he earned renown as one of the greatest
        players in history, helping FC Barcelona win more than two dozen league titles and tournaments. In 2012, he set
        a record for most goals in a calendar year and, a decade later, helped the Argentina national team win its third
        FIFA World Cup. The seven-time Ballon dOr winner moved to Paris Saint-Germain in 2021, and in July 2023, he
        joined MLS Inter Miami club.<br></br> <br>

        Luis Lionel Andres “Leo” Messi was born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Argentina. As a young boy, Messi tagged
        along when his two older brothers played soccer with their friends, unintimidated by the bigger boys. At the age
        of 8, he was recruited to join the youth system of Newell’s Old Boys, a Rosario-based club.<br></br> </br> 

        Recognizably smaller than most of the kids in his age group, Messi was eventually diagnosed by doctors as
        suffering from a hormone deficiency that restricted his growth. Messi’s parents, Jorge and Ceclia, decided on a
        regimen of nightly growth-hormone injections for their son, though it soon proved impossible to pay several
        hundred dollars per month for the medication.

        So, at the age of 13, when Messi was offered the chance to train at soccer powerhouse FC Barcelona’s youth
        academy, La Masia, and have his medical bills covered by the team, Messi’s family picked up and moved across the
        Atlantic to make a new home in Spain. Although he was often homesick in his new country, Messi moved quickly
        through the junior system ranks.

        Ultimately, Messi’s short stature—5 feet, 7 inches—combined with his speed and relentless attacking style, has
        drawn comparisons to another famous Argentinian footballer, Diego Maradona.
